    #Key Components                     //use 'go run <file_name>' to run file, or 'go build' to run application (cannot run without creating a module -- 'go mod init example.com/first-go-ap')
                                        //run a file with './first-go-app (or file_name)
package main                            //split packages among program, can have multiple packages in one file and multiple files in one
                                        //package, ORGANIZES CODE

import "fmt"                            //built in package that gives standard fxns and packages

func main() {                           //calling function, must be called main because Go executes main fxn to start a program
    fmt.Print("Hello World")            //executes command, main application code should be wrapped into this fxn, only one main fxn
}
